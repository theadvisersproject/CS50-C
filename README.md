# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Among the overarching goals for students individually in this course is that they learn something that we haven’t taught them, as is manifest at term’s end by so many students’ final projects that use languages, libraries, tools, and techniques not taught in the course. Along the way will students learn to

* think more methodically,
* program procedurally,
* represent and process information,
* communicate succinctly and precisely,
* solve problems efficiently,
* recognize patterns among problems,
* decompose problems into parts and compose solutions thereto,
* operate at multiple levels of abstraction,
* separate design from implementation details,
* infer from first principles how systems work,
* assess the correctness, design, and style of code,
* teach themselves new languages,
* identify threats to privacy and security,
* read documentation, drawing conclusions from specifications,
* test solutions to problems, find faults, and identify corner cases,
* describe symptoms of problems precisely and ask questions clearly, and
* identify and quantify tradeoffs among resources, particularly time and space.
